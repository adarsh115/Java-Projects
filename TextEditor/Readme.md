## My process

### Tools and Technology

1) For making user interface i have used Java Swing Api.Swing API is a set of extensible GUI Components to ease the developer's life to create JAVA based Front End/GUI Applications. It is build on top of AWT API and acts as a replacement of AWT API, since it has almost every control corresponding to AWT controls. Swing component follows a Model-View-Controller architecture to fulfill the following criterias.

- A single API is to be sufficient to support multiple look and feel.
- API is to be model driven so that the highest level API is not required to have data.
- API is to use the Java Bean model so that Builder Tools and IDE can provide better services to the developers for use.

2) Object oriented programming for to structuring the project
3) Java for coding the project


### Layout
I started project by making a GUI class which will have all the components required for making this desktop application functional. 
-createWindow(): Window for desktop application
-createTextArea(): This will give users text area for writing and editing text
-createMenuBar(): Top menu which have formating and file menu
-createFileMenu(): This is file menu inside of Menu bar, allows user to open, save and save as file
-CreatFormatMenu(): This is for formatting text, basically it provide user with changing font size & style and text wrapping 


### What I learned
- Java Swing
- Using object oriented appoach for building project
- Building desktop Applications
- Breaking project into small components and the building components 


### Useful resources
- Youtube videos on java swing.
- Blogs on project made using swing

This application can be further imporved by adding more functionalities.
- UI can be improved by adding color
- Option to choose Text area color
- More fonts can be added
